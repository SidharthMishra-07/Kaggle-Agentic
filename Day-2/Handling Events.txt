The agent won't automatically handle pause/resume. Every long-running operation workflow requires you to:

    1. Detect the pause: Check if events contain adk_request_confirmation
    2. Get human decision: In production, show UI and wait for user click. Here, we simulate it.
    3. Resume the agent: Send the decision back with the saved invocation_id

Understand Key Technical Concepts
👉 events - ADK creates events as the agent executes. Tool calls, model responses, function results - all become events

👉 adk_request_confirmation event - This event is special - it signals "pause here!"
        Automatically created by ADK when your tool calls request_confirmation()
        Contains the invocation_id
        Your workflow must detect this event to know the agent paused

👉 invocation_id - Every call to run_async() gets a unique invocation_id (like "abc123")
        When a tool pauses, you save this ID
        When resuming, pass the same ID so ADK knows which execution to continue
        Without it, ADK would start a NEW execution instead of resuming the paused one



Code breakdown
Step 1: Send initial request to the Agent

Call run_async() to start agent execution
Collect all events in a list for inspection
Step 2: Detect Pause

Call check_for_approval(events) to look for the special event: adk_request_confirmation
Returns approval info (with invocation_id) if the special event is present; None if completed
Step 3: Resume execution

PATH A:

If the approval info is present, at this point the Agent pauses for human input.
Once the Human input is available, call the agent again using run_async() and pass in the Human input.
Critical: Same invocation_id (tells ADK to RESUME, not restart)
Display agent's final response after resuming
PATH B:

If the approval info is not present, then approval is not needed and the agent completes execution.
