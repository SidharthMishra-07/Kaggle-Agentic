Long-Running Operations (Human-in-the-Loop)

So far, all tools execute and return immediately:
User asks → Agent calls tool → Tool returns result → Agent responds

--But what if your tools are long-running or you need human approval before completing an action?
--Example: A shipping agent should ask for approval before placing a large order.

User asks → Agent calls tool → Tool PAUSES and asks human → Human approves → Tool completes → Agent responds

This is called a Long-Running Operation (LRO) - the tool needs to pause, wait for external input (human approval), then resume.


## When to use Long-Running Operations:

💰 Financial transactions requiring approval (transfers, purchases)
🗑️ Bulk operations (delete 1000 records - confirm first!)
📋 Compliance checkpoints (regulatory approval needed)
💸 High-cost actions (spin up 50 servers - are you sure?)
⚠️ Irreversible operations (permanently delete account)
