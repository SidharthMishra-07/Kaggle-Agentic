This is a common question! Both involve using multiple agents, but they work very differently:

--> Agent Tools (what we're using):

Agent A calls Agent B as a tool
Agent B's response goes back to Agent A
Agent A stays in control and continues the conversation
Use case: Delegation for specific tasks (like calculations)

--> Sub-Agents (different pattern):

Agent A transfers control completely to Agent B
Agent B takes over and handles all future user input
Agent A is out of the loop
Use case: Handoff to specialists (like customer support tiers)
In our currency example: We want the currency agent to get calculation results and continue working with them, so we use Agent Tools, not sub-agents.
