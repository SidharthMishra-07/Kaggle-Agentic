--> What is Memory?

Memory is a service that provides long-term knowledge storage for your agents. The key distinction:

    Session = Short-term memory (single conversation)
    Memory = Long-term knowledge (across multiple conversations)

Think of it in software engineering terms: Session is like application state (temporary), while Memory is like a database (persistent).


--> Memory Workflow

In order to integrate Memory into your Agents, there are three high-level steps.

Three-step integration process:
    Initialize → Create a MemoryService and provide it to your agent via the Runner
    Ingest → Transfer session data to memory using add_session_to_memory()
    Retrieve → Search stored memories using search_memory()


--> Memory Retrieval in ADK

ADK provides two built-in tools for memory retrieval:

load_memory (Reactive)

    Agent decides when to search memory
    Only retrieves when the agent thinks it's needed
    More efficient (saves tokens)
    Risk: Agent might forget to search

preload_memory (Proactive)

    Automatically searches before every turn
    Memory always available to the agent
    Guaranteed context, but less efficient
    Searches even when not needed

Think of it like studying for an exam: load_memory is looking things up only when you need them, while preload_memory is reading all your notes before answering each question.
