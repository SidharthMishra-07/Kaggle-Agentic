--> What is a Session?

📦 Session
A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a single, continuous conversation. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.

In ADK, a Session is comprised of two key components Events and State:

📝 Session.Events:

While a session is a container for conversations, Events are the building blocks of a conversation.

Example of Events:
    User Input: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)
    Agent Response: The agent's reply to the user
    Tool Call: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API
    Tool Output: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning

📝 Session.State:

session.state is the Agent's scratchpad, where it stores and updates dynamic details needed during the conversation. Think of it as a global {key, value} pair storage which is available to all subagents and tools.




--> How to manage sessions?

An agentic application can have multiple users and each user may have multiple sessions with the application. To manage these sessions and events, ADK offers a Session Manager and Runner.

SessionService: The storage layer

Manages creation, storage, and retrieval of session data
Different implementations for different needs (memory, database, cloud)
Runner: The orchestration layer

Manages the flow of information between user and agent
Automatically maintains conversation history
Handles the Context Engineering behind the scenes
Think of it like this:

Session = A notebook 📓
Events = Individual entries in a single page 📝
SessionService = The filing cabinet storing notebooks 🗄️
Runner = The assistant managing the conversation 🤖
