--> The Limitation of Raw Storage

What we've stored so far:

    Every user message
    Every agent response
    Every tool call
    
The problem:

    Session: 50 messages = 10,000 tokens
    Memory:  All 50 messages stored
    Search:  Returns all 50 messages → Agent must process 10,000 tokens

This doesn't scale. We need consolidation.

--> What is Memory Consolidation?

Memory Consolidation = Extracting only important facts while discarding conversational noise.

Before (Raw Storage):
    User: "My favorite color is BlueGreen. I also like purple. 
        Actually, I prefer BlueGreen most of the time."
    Agent: "Great! I'll remember that."
    User: "Thanks!"
    Agent: "You're welcome!"

    → Stores ALL 4 messages (redundant, verbose)

After (Consolidation):
    Extracted Memory: "User's favorite color: BlueGreen"

    → Stores 1 concise fact


--> Next Steps for Memory Consolidation

Key Point: Managed Memory Services handle consolidation automatically.

You use the same API:
    add_session_to_memory() ← Same method
    search_memory() ← Same method
    
The difference: What happens behind the scenes.
    InMemoryMemoryService: Stores raw events
    VertexAiMemoryBankService: Intelligently consolidates before storing
